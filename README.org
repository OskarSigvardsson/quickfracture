*UPDATE*

I streamed the development of this effect on Twitch, but unfortunately those archives are long gone down the memory hole. Also unfortunately, I never properly finished this. Life and other projects came in the way. That means that this repo is very much in a half-finished state, and the effect itself (while very cool!) is not in any kind of production ready state. I'll leave the repo up, and it's licensed using MIT, so anyone who want to incorporate this into their game is free to go right ahead, but beware: you'll have to do some amount of work on your own to if you want it to run in a real game. 

Original README follows:

* Cool 3d destruction effect in Unity!
My name is Oskar Sigvardsson, and I'm making a cool 3d destruction
effect in Unity. I'm streaming the development over at [[https://www.twitch.tv/chessbiscuit][Twitch]]! Come
hang out in the chat, or just watch the archives.

I wasn't planning on releasing this effect publicly in a repository
this early, but I figure the people on the stream might want to check
it out, so here it is. Keep in mind, this repository is in a VERY
ROUGH shape, not really intended for public consumption. There's all
sorts of nonsense hee, like random meshes, unfinished pieces of code
and unused scenes. The only thing in any kind of shape is the "test"
scene, so open that if you want to check it out. For more details,
check the streams!

Oh, and yeah, here's demo:
